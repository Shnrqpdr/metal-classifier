These projects developing in the two notebooks with the same name are projects that is a part of a series of projects developed in ML course of Physics Institute of UFF (Universidade Federal Fluminense). Here, we are using machine learning model to classify a list of two-dimensional non magnetic materials into a metal or insulator material. The data are provided by C2DB Database.
